# Mission maxima

of the Trilobite project is to sthap stupid humans from copypasting as many high level entities as possible.
This is gonna be achieved by creating an abstract general web-service that can be converted to any needed service just by disabling some unnecessary features.

Now let me explain, what is the "copypaste of high level entities". As it was said

> I saw trilobites and there are many of them, I saw the Trilobite and I am the Trilobite.

And so it is: most of the services we can see on the web right now aren't any special.
Just try to describe the difference between few popular social networks or messengers and you'll see that the most significant difference between the applications themselves is how they do limit you.
Some of them allow you to post only a text, only an image or only a video (of limited size sometimes).
Some allow you to comment content posted by others.
Some allow you to comment comments created by others.
Some allow you to comment comments commenting comments event if those comments comment comments, some don't.
Some allow you to react to pieces of content created by others with likes/dislikes, some allow wider ranges of reactions (sometimes even extensible by users).
Some of them notify you about events you are subscribed to (with browser notifications, notifications on your smartphone/desktop device, emails, SMS, messages in other applications, etc.), some use your reaction to notifications to understand, how good the event is and how should be others notified, thus making event authors to include requests to "subscribe, like, enable all notifications" in their content (and that sucks).
Etc, etc, etc...

But behind all this stuff there is a finite set of concepts that can interact in a finite set of ways.
Entities implementing those concepts are created again and again for every new application - that is a high-level copypaste.
The codes may be written in different languages and using different approaches, they may have no one matching line but they are all the same - that is a high-level copypaste.
Millions of human-hours and thus thousands of human lives are wasted writing the same stuff in different way again and again - that is a high-level copypaste.

Of course there are some unique functionalities some applications happen to have.
But even developers of the most unique web-application ever have spent a lot of time to implement authentication/authorization logic.

So the purpose of the Trilobite project is to create a superapplication implementing all possible concepts modern web-applications use and supporting all possible interactions between them.
I.e. in unlimited version of such application user will be able to post anything, comment a post/message/comment/reaction/user, react in any possible way to any post/comment/message/user/reaction etc.
In trilobite supperapp the following could happen:

- An unknown user reacts to your profile with üòê
- You react to that reaction with üôÉ
- That user comments your üôÉ with text: "wtf did you mean?"
- ‚ôû leaves the chat

The unlimited trilobite superapp can later be limited to become the service it's owner wants it to be e.g. a personal blog, new ambitious social network or messenger, todo list, site with reviews of national space programs, chat for local SJW band etc.
This superapp also should provide simple means to integrate that-rare-only-unique function the service is unique because.

# Mission minima

of the Trilobite project is to have fun writing some useless abstract code because we can.
