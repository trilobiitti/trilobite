# Backend module

## Motivation

Purpose of Trilobite Backend module is to provide a so-called middleware between

* Applications providing interface for humans (including ones implemented with Trilobite Frontend)
* Robots
* Anything else, able to interact using protocols supported by the Trilobite Backend

on one side and

* information storages, such as all sorts types and kinds of databases, filesystems
* algorithms
* 3-rd party services

on the other side.

As declared in [Trilobite Mission Statement](MISSION_STATEMENT.md), the system should be flexible enough to allow as many actions as possible and disallow any subset of them.

## Architecture

TBD
