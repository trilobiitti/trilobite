# Trilobite

Stupid. Primitive. Useless.

## Philosophy

* I saw trilobites and there are many of them, I saw the Trilobite and I am the Trilobite.
* The unformalizable s-word called "readability" is for humanities and other losers. The good code is the one you don't need to read and edit 'cause it just works. "Write-only" code sounds good.
* UX, SEO, PR and other s-words are for people who do useless things. The useful thing will be found and will be used.
